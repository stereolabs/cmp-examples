# Object Detection

> **NOTE**: The source code of this application and a code explaination are available [here](https://github.com/stereolabs/cmp-examples/tree/main/tutorials)

This sample is a complete exemple that shows you how to perform Object detection in a CMP App. It also shows how to use the C++ API to generate:
- **Logs** that informs you about the app's status
- **Telemetry** that stores data linked to the detections
- **Video Event** that shows you the video on wich someone is detected
- **Custom Stream** that shows you the live video, with bbox around the detected people

The app also have several **parameters** that can be modified in the CMP interface and will have an impact on the application.

## What you should see after deployment
Make sure that the recordings are enable and that the privacy mode is disabled (Settings panel of your device, in the CMP interface).
As this app shows you most of the CMP features, you will have:
- a **Custom Stream** that shows you the live video, with bbox around the detected people
- **Logs** that informs you about the app's status
- **Telemetries** that store data linked to the detections
- **Video Events** that shows you the video on wich someone is detected

The app also have several **parameters** that can be modified in the CMP interface and will have an impact on the application.

### Custom stream

A video with Bboxes around people should be available in the **Video** panel

### Logs
Some logs should inform you about the app status.

### Telemetry
Some telemetry containing data about detection should be available and generated every 10 seconds by default.

### Video Event

A video is concidered as event if **at least on person is detected** in the image. Therefore if your app is running and that someone is seen by your ZED, you should see an Event in the Video Event panel corresponding to this situation.

You can click on it. You have access the video and the stored data of the event. You have access to a longer video than the exact event duration ( you can watch a few seconds before and after the event). The blue line indicates which part of the video is associated to the event.

### Parameters

Five parameters can be used to modify your app behaviour:

- **Draw Bboxes**: If selected, will draw boxes around detected people in on the camera live view

- **Enable Video Events**:  If selected some video Event will be recorded when someone will be detected on the video

- **Number of frames without det Btw 2 Events**:  Number of frames without detection between two video event: if no one is seen for the defined number of frame, next time that someone is detected a new event is defined instead of continuing previous event


- **Record Telemetry**:   If selected, the app will send the number of people detected and other info as telemetry.

- **Telemetry frequency**:   Telemetry frequency defined how often telemetry is generated by the app. Every 10 seconds by default.

## Deployment

### Requirements

You will deploy this tutorial on one of the devices installed on your CMP workspace. The CMP supports Jetson Nano, TX2 and Xavier or any computer. If you are using a Jetson, make sure it has been flashed. If you haven't done it already, [flash your Jetson](https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/install-with-sdkm-jetson/index.html).

To be able to run this tutorial:
- [Sign In the CMP and created a workspace](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/cloud/overview/get-started/).
- [Add and Setup a device](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/cloud/overview/get-started/#add-a-camera).
- A ZED must be plugged to this device.
- **Enable recordings** and **disable privacy mode** in the Settings panel of your device

### How to deploy your application
You just need to [deploy your app](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/cloud/applications/sample/#deploy) using the CMP interface:

- Select the devices on which you want to deploy the app 
- Click on the **Deploy** button
